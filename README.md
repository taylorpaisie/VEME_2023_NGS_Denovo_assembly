### 1. Introduction to sequence assembly
#### What does "sequence assembly" mean?
#### Assembly is a “catch-all” term used to describe methods where we combine shorter individual measurements called reads into longer contiguous sequences typically called contigs
#### Because the sequencing process works by breaking the original DNA into smaller fragments, the assembly process is conceptually similar to putting together an image puzzle from its many pieces
#### The software that performs the assembly is called the assembler.
#### We will learn how to *de novo* assemble reads obtained with the Illumina sequencing platform using [SPAdes](http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/., an assembly toolkit containing various assembly pipelines

#### *De novo* assembly usually includes the following steps:  
1. Improving of the reads quality (remove adapters, trim reads, etc..
2. De novo assembly of the overlapping reads into contigs
3. Joining contigs into scaffolds
4. Comparison with other known genomes
5. Filling the gaps
6. Verification of the assembled genome
7. Annotation of the assembled genome

#### Challenges of *de novo* assembly
#### Sequence assembly is perhaps the application domain of bioinformatics where skill and expertise are the most difficult to identify and define   
#### Assemblers are quite unlike any other software tool you will ever use. Most come with a bewildering array of parameters - the purpose of which are not explained, yet many will have profound effects on the results that they produce  

#### Trial and error are one of the most commonly used strategies - you will have to keep tuning the parameters and rerun the entire process hoping that the results improve - sometimes in vain  
#### As it turns out, genome assembly is the most computational demanding bioinformatics method of them all  
#### Assembling a large genome may take even weeks(!. and substantial computational resources  
#### Thus any expertise built on trial and error will have to be accumulated over a much more extended period  
#### Finally, even when assembly appears to work, almost always it will contain several severe and substantial errors. That is where, in our opinion, bioinformatics expertise matters more  
#### The ability to understand, visualize and correct the mistakes of an assembly has a utility that will outlast the present and is more valuable than knowing the exact invocation of a tool by heart

#### Multidrug resistant bacteria have become a major public health threat. Phage therapy may to be used as an alternative to antibiotics or, as a supplementary approach to treat some bacterial infections   
#### Bacteriophages have been applied in clinical practice for the treatment of localized infections in wounds, burns, and trophic ulcers, including diabetic foot ulcers (PMC6083058)  
#### In this study, bacteria were collected from trophic ulcers of the patients  
#### For each sample, the unique bacteriophage was selected from bacteriophage cocktails produced by [MicroGen](https://www.microgen.ru/en/) or from environmental samples based on its efficiency against the bacteria  
#### Bacteriophages that were successful in treating diabetic foot disease were sequenced using NGS technology   
#### The sample we will be using is a 2x250 Illumina sequenced bacteriophage  
#### The goal of this exercise is to assemble the genome of a sequenced bacteriophage  


### 2. Trimming Fastq files  


#### First we will run FastQC on the raw fastq files:  

`$ fastqc *.fastq.gz`


#### Now run Trimmomatic on the raw fastq files:  

`$ trimmomatic PE 169_S7_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz  169_S7_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz \`  
`169_S7_L001_R1_001.trim.fastq.gz 169_S7_L001_R1_001un.trim.fastq.gz \`  
`169_S7_L001_R2_001.trim.fastq.gz 169_S7_L001_R2_001un.trim.fastq.gz \`  
`SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:25 ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:40:15`  


#### Run FastQC on newly trimmed fastq files:  

`$ fastqc *trim.fastq.gz`

### 3. Sequence Assembly

#### We will be using the program [SPades](http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/) for *de novo* assembly  

#### Spades will automatically make the final scaffolds:  

`$ spades.py -k 21,33,55,77,99,127 --isolate -1 169_S7_L001_R1_001.trim.fastq.gz \`  
`-2 169_S7_L001_R2_001.trim.fastq.gz -o spades_output`   

`ls -l spades_output`  

#### Notice in our `spades_output` directory we have both a `contigs.fasta` and a `scaffolds.fasta`  

#### SPades makes both files, but we will be using the `scaffolds.fasta` for this exercise


#### Create and move scaffolds from SPades to results directory:  

`$ mkdir -p results/scaffolds`  
`$ mv spades_output/scaffolds.fasta ../../results/scaffolds`  
`$ cd ../..`  

#### We now want to be at the `denovo_assembly` directory




### 4. Comparing the scaffolds to other known genomes

#### We will know take our scaffolds and use [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to compare our newly assembled genome to other genomes  

<figure>
    <img src="blast_results.png" width="500" height="400">
    <figcaption>BLAST results from our scaffolds</figcaption>
</figure>

#### BLAST found similar genomes  
#### The closest is Pseudomonas phage CMS1, complete genome (OM937766.1), with coverage of 99% and identity of 98.53%  
#### OM937766 has three matches for the contig sequence, all are plus/plus strand  
#### Examination of the GenBank record for OM937766 finds that organism is "PPseudomonas phage CMS1" and the taxon ID is 2926659  
#### Another closely related genome is RefSeq NC_031063.1, Pseudomonas phage PEV2
